4. Rewrite the following code so it's correct.
    color: 0000ff;
    A: color: #0000ff;

5. Holding down the left mouse button, drag the pieces of code onto the screen to create a class of heading named "standout"
    A:  h2.standout {
            color: #ff0000;
        }

        }

8. Create a class that isn't tied to an element that specifies any color you like. Create the color specification by using any combination of numbers 0 through 9 and a through f. Don't worry about what the actual color is. Make up the class name.

            color: #ff1234;

        }
