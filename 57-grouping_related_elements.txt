57 - Grouping related elements

Notes
    * If your form has a lot of parts, you can improve the user's experience by grouping related parts together visually by using the fieldset tags.
        * <fieldset></fieldset>
        * Everything within the fieldset tags is indented 2 spaces.
    * Can improve the readability of the form even further by adding legends-descriptive text that's at the top of the box.
        * <legend></legend>
        * The legend tags go on the line following the opening fieldset tag and, like everything enclosed by the fieldset tags, are indented 2 spaces.
