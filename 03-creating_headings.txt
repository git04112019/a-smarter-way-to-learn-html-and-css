3 - Creating Headings

Notes
    * HTML gives you six sizes of headings to choose from, h1 through h6.
        * h1 is the largest, h6 is the smallest.
        * You don't have to include all the different sizes of headings in your HTML document, but you should include h1 heading, because search engines look for it.
    * If you want the browser to break the heading a certain way, you have to tell it to do so explicitly, using the tag <br>.
        * There are no space between the text and <br>. 
        * And there's no closing br tag.
    * By default, browsers separate paragraphs by adding space between them.
