45 - Tables: Spacing part 1

Notes
    * By default, browsers don't add breathing room b/w the table cell borders and the text they contain, the solution is to add padding.
    * If you want cells spaced apart even father than the browser default, you need to specify the border-spacing. Note the spacing is for the table and not th or td.
    table {
        border-spacing: 1em;
    }
