23 - Images

Notes
    * Images on a webpage are almost always one of three types: jpg, gif, or png.
        * jpg format is best for photographs and for illustrations with many subtle colors.
        * gif format can be used for line drawings, illustrations with just a few colors, and images of text.
            * gif offers transparency, meaning that the background color can show through whatever you want it to.
            * gifs can be animated. Unless you need animation, the gif format is rarely your best choice.
        * png format has the same general featuers as gif, but has no animation.
            * It is prefered because it gives you higher quality than a gif and is smaller file size.
                * Smaller file size means pages load faster.
        * <img src="name of subfolder/filename.type">
            * No closing tag
        * img src stands for "image source."
