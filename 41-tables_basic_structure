41 - Tables: basic structure 

Notes
    * All the HTML code for a table is enclosed in an opening and closing tag.
    <table>
        [The details of the table go here.]
    </table>
    * Below is a table with two rows and two columns.
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 1, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 1, column 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 2, column 1</td>
            <td>Row 2, column 2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    * Unless you style a border explicitly, most browsers display it without borders.
    * You create a row using the <tr> (for "table row") tag.
    * Then you create all the cells within that row using the <td> (for "table data") tag.
        * All the text content of a table cell is enclosed between the opening tag and the closing <td> tag.
    * The opening <tr> tag and closing </tr> tag don't enclose any text content.
        * They only contain the <td> tags and their text content.
    * Each row must have the same number of cells, created with the <td> and </td> tags, even if some of the cells are empty.
