13 - Spacing

Notes
    * letter-spacing:
        * When you specify an em value for letter-spacing, it tells the browser how much more space you want beyond the normal spacing.
        * OR how much less. (you can have a negative em value)
    * For default letter-spacing use a value of zero.
    * word-spacing:
        * If you want to adjust spacing only between words.
        * Not used very often.
    * line-height:
        * Used to specify the space between text lines.
        * 1.2em for default line spacing.
        * 1.8em is approximately an extra half-line of spacing.
        * 1em would be slightly tighter spacing than normal.
