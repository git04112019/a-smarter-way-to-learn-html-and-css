59 - Comments

Notes
    * Commenting is a way to tell the browser to ignore certain portions of text that you include within the body of code.
    * Comments are for the human, not the machine. It helps you and others understand the code when it comes time to revise.
    * Can also use commenting to comment out portions of your code for testing and debugging.
    * In HTML any text enclosed by an opening <!-- tag and a closing --> tag is invisible to the browser.
    * Can also comment CSS code, but the tags are different. It's /* to open, */ to close.
