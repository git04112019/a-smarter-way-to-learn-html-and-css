52 - Forms: submit

Notes
    <input type="submit" value="Send email message.">
    * This is a simple input tag, with only two parts.
    * The first part creates the button that, when clicked, submits the form.
    * The second part specifies the button text.
    * The submit tag creates a standard button.
    * If you want a custom button, create your own button image and write a tag like this.
        <input type="image" src="images/subscribe-button.png" alt="Sign up" width="72" height="18">
        * The browser knows this is a Submit button even though you say input type is "image".
