47 - Tables: aligning text 

Notes
    * The same code to align text on a page can be used to align text in table cells.
        text-align: left;
        text-align: right;
        text-align: center;
        text-align: jusitfy;
    * Center is the default text alignment for table data cells. 
    * You can also control the vertical alignment within cells, using...
        vertical-align: top;
        vertical-align: bottom;
        vertical-align: center;
    * However, you can't specify vertical alignment for the whole table, only for <th> and <td> elements.
        * By default text is vertically centered in both <th> and <td> cells.
