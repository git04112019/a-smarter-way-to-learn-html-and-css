10 - Font-Style

Notes
    * Italic font-style can also be written as <i></i> and <em></em>.
        * The main difference is that when a screen reader sees the <em> tag, it puts extra vocal emphasis on the text enclosed in the tag. It doesn't do that with <i> text.
    * Instead of creating a class for bold text in CSS, you can use the <b> tag in HTML.
    * An alternative to the <b> tag is the <strong> tag.
        * The main difference is that when a screen reader sees the <strong> tag, the reader may say the text in a lower tone. It doesn't do that with <b> text.
