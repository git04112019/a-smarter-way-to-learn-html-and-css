42 - Tables: headings

Notes
    * You begin by creating a row for the headings, just as you would for regular cells. Then, using the opening <th> (for "table heading") and closing </th> tags, you construct cells with text in them, as you would for regular text cells.
        * scope="col" to create a heading for each column
        * scope="row" to create a heading for each row
    * Use a blank column heading when using both row and column headings. This tells the browser that there is no column heading over the column of row headings.
        * <th scope="col"></th>
