54 - Forms: Checkboxes

Notes
    * Checkboxes work like radio buttons, except that the user can check more than one.
    * As with radio buttons, each checkbox has its own separate input tag.
    * And again, what binds all the checkboxes in a group together is that they're all given the same name.
