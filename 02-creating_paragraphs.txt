2 - Creating Paragraphs

Notes
    * When you enter a carriage return in an HTML document, the browser ignores it. If you want to display your two sentences in separate paragraphs, you have to explicitly tell the browser to do it.
    * Usually, tags come in pairs, an opening tag paired with a closing tag.

    Things to keep in mind:
    * It's legal to write <P> instead of <p> but I'll ask you to stick to lower-case tags.
    * There are no spaces between the tags and the text that they enclose.
    * Good housekeeping demands that whenever the browser expects a closing tag, you provide it. Sometimes you can get away with writing <p> without closing with </p>, but it can produce unpredictable results.
