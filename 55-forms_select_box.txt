55 - Forms: select box

Notes
    * A select box works well when you want the user to select from a list thatâ€™s too long to be handled gracefully by radio buttons.
    * Like radio buttons, only one selection can be made in a select box.
    * Starts with <select, not <input type=
        <select name="pet-list">
        <option value="loris">loris</option>
        </select>
    * Unlike radio buttons and checkboxes, which are freestanding and bound together by a common name, all the choices are enclosed by opening and closing select tags.
    * Unlike most other input types, option tags are closed.
    * The name is specified only once, in the select tag.
