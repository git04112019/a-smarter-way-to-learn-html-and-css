Notes
    * Font-weight ranges from 100 through 900.
        * 100 is the lightest weight.
        * 400 is normal.
        * 900 is heaviest.
    * As an alternative to the numerical scale, you can use one of four font-weight words:
        * lighter
        * normal
        * bold
        * bolder
