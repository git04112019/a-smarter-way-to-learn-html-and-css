49 - Forms: the form tag

Notes
    * In most cases, when a user completes a form, a program separate from the HTML file runs.
    * An HTML file is stored on the host's server but runs in the user's browser.
    * If you don't specify a method, the get method is used.
    * The function of a PHP or other program called in the form tag is to process data.
