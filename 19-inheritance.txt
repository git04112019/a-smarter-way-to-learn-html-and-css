19 - Inheritance

Notes
    * Inheritance is an efficiency feature of CSS. It means you have to write far less code.
        * Body is parent of all the content that displays on the page.
        * Both head and body have a parent, HTML.
    * Inherited styles can be overwritten.
        * When overriding an inherited size with an em value, it is relative to the inherited size.
        * This is the reason why many developers use 1em as the default size for the body.
