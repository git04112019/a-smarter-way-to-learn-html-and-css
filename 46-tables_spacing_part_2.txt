46 - Tables: spacing part 2

Notes
    * By default, browsers adjust cell size to contents.
    * However, instead of letting the browser allocate space on the basis of need, style the cells so they'd all be 20% of the width of the full table.
        * In other words, they'd all have the same width.
    * Note that the browser automatically wraps longer lines into multiple lines to fit them into the width.
    * By default a table occupies 100% of the width of the window or div.
