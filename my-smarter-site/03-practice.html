    <h1>Optimist Creed</h1>
    <h2>I promise myself...</h2>
    <p>To be so strong that nothing can disturb my peace of mind.<br>
      To talk health, happiness, and prosperity to every person I meet.<br>
      To make all my friends feel that there is something worthwhile in them.<br>
      To look at the sunny side of everything and make my optimisim come true.<br>
      To think only of the best, to work only for the best<br>
      And to expect only the best.<br>
      To be just as enthusiastic about the success of others as I am about my own.<br>
      To forget the mistakes of the past and press on to the<br>
      Greater achievements of the future.<br>
      To wear a cheerful expression at all times and give a smile<br>
      To every living creature I meet.<br>
      To give so much time to improving myself that I<br>
      Have no time to criticize others.<br>
      To be too large for worry, too noble for anger, too strong for fear,<br>
      And too happy to permit the presence of trouble.<br>
      To think well of myself and to proclaim this fact to the world,<br>
      Not in loud word, but in great deeds.<br>
      To live in the faith the Universe is on my side<br>
      So long as I am true to the best that is in me.</p>
