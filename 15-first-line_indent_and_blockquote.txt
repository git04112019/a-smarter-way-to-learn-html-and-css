15 - First-Line Indent and Blockquote

Notes
    * text-indent:
        * Any positive em value gives you an indent. The larger the value, the deeper the indent.
        * To explicitly specify the default, no first-line indent, use a value of zero.
    * Use blockquote to visually set off a quotation that's more than a few words long.
        * Any paragraph placed inside blockquote tags is indented, by default.
        * <blockquote></blockquote>
        * Default blockquote styling can be changed in CSS.
